#Guess the Number
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is a guessing game, where a player has to guess a randomly generated number with as little tries as possible.

The game is relativly simple, upon starting or reseting, a random number from 1 to 20 is generated. The player then enters a number and the program tells him whether the number he entered is too high, too low or indeed correct.
Using information given to player, player enters a new number to try to guess the number and repeats the actions until successful.
Upon correctly guessing the random number, he has an option to reset the game that will generate a new random number.
