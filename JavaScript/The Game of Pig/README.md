#The Game of Pig

This simple dice game is for two players where the goal is to reach 100 points.

The game is relativly simple, 
after rolling the dice a player has an option to continue rolling the dice and adding up the dice roll results 
or an option to hold, which adds the sum to his total points and switches players.
If an active player rolls a 1, he automatically loses his turn to play and loses all scores gained in that turn.

Other player has the same options as the first player, the contest goes until one of the players reach 100 points or more.
