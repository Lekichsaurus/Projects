Junior Frontend Developer (React) - Job application task - Calendar App
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were given the task to create a calendar application on the user interface. We were given some basic guidelines and instructions and the rest was up to us to make as desired.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The calendar is filled with tasks so that users can get the idea of the calendar upon launching.
In order to create a task, users must simply double click on a day where they want to create a task.
Every task can be deleted using the "delete" button on a keyboard, every task can be moved using a mouse with drag&drop method.
